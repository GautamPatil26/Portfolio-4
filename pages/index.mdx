## Experience

### PTC, Pune  
**Associate Information & Cybersecurity Analyst**  
**07/2024 - Present**

- Performed Source Code Analysis, Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Black Duck, OWASP Dependency-Check, Checkmarx, and Veracode.
- Implemented Checkmarx & Black Duck source code analysis automation and JIRA integration using Python APIs; automated workflows with GitHub Actions and Jenkins to streamline vulnerability tracking and reduce manual effort.
- Conducted secure code reviews for web and mobile applications, identifying vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, insecure authentication, and authorization flaws.
- Developed a Security Requirements AI Agent using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically map OWASP ASVS security requirements to features and stories with high accuracy.
- Built and maintained threat models during the design phase to identify potential attack vectors early in the SDLC.
- Designed and implemented a Custom PenTest AI Tool leveraging Model Context Protocols (MCP), Agentic AI, and function calling, powering an automated reconnaissance assistant and reducing manual offensive security effort by ~20%.
- Solved critical security vulnerabilities, strengthening overall application security posture.
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance protection against cross-site scripting and client-side vulnerabilities.
- Led security design reviews for new applications and features to identify risks early in the SDLC.
- Automated OWASP ZAP scanning using Python and integrated it into CI/CD pipeline across Development, Staging, and Production environments.
